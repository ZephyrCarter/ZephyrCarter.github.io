<h3>Questiones I asked Officer D. Masis of the Oakland Police Department</h3>
<ul>

<li>The Second amendment says that in addition to a well regulated militia, the  right to keep and bear arms by the people is essential to a free state. What is your opinion on things like concealed carry, or states regulations on firearms?</li>
<li>According to the fourth amendment, police cannot search a property without a warrant, except with probable cause, so can you please explain what probable cause is? Can you please give me an example of probable cause?</li>
<li>The first amendment states that among other things, the public has a right to assemble peacefully. What is your opinion on this? What if the protest becomes non peaceful, what should the police do then?</li>
  
</ul>
