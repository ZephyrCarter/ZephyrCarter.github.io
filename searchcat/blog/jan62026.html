<h4>Jan 6, 2026</h4>
  So some things for the day:
  <p>
  1) I finished the second letter on the project im working on!!<br>
  3) The feather is coming along great, i hope to be done by the beginning of next week if i lock in!<br>
  2) I am so pumped to give my pitch for my beading to my counselor/when i get a counselor!<br>
</p>
  So, first things first, I finished the letter 'S' on the feather I am working on. I personally didn't think/was worried that "my
  math wouldn't math" but I was wrong to worry! I am really stoked on the results, as I did calculate correctly, yay!<br>
  Second, I am really pumped to finish the feather, I really wanna finish soon/at the end of the week. My plan is to POSSIBLY take a photo 
  of it and show it as an example of my work ability, with my other work, but I am unsure if that's fair to the person I'm making
  it for. I'll ask, lol.<br>
  Aaaand last but not least, going to see if I can get a communications Merit badge counselor at the meeting on the 8th. I am also 
  gonna see if I can also knock out a requirement to pitch my counselor my beadwork ability and see how I do. My goal is to get this
  done in the same meeting.
  <p>
    Other than that, ie. having finished the second letter, hoping to finish it soon and possibly giving my buisness pitch to my counselor,I look forward
    to the next day of beading adventures, stay tuned for more!!
