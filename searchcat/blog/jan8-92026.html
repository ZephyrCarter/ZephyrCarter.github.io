<h1>The Beading Blog</h1>

<h4>Jan 8-9, 2026</h4>
  So some things for the day:
  <p>
  1) I finished almost all of the feather!<br>
  3) I locked in!<br>
  2) I forgot to give my pitch to my (future) MB counselor<br>
</p>
  So, to begin, I took some time and BEADED the feather I'm making for a friend. I got into a flow state, beading and beading while listening
  to music. That felt really nice, but I had tos stop because I was getting tired.<br>
  Second, I actually spent a lot of my night beading. So like after a lot of work doing my thing, ive gotten it to ablot 1-2 
  hours left if I go slow. This is a very fun project, so I really wanna continue (realisticly) on sunday<br>
  Third things is that unfortuatly, as of yesterday on the meeting, I forgot to give my pitch about my beading skill. It worked out 
  for the better though, as I actually got to work on the Troop's website and fix the propblem we have been facing. I guess I'm gonna have
  to finish feather and then possibly show it/a lot of my other work to the counselor as an example of my skill.
  <p>
    Aside from the great news of the feather I'm working on almost being finished, the dedication I put into it even into the night,
    and the little hickup/plan not going exactly as expected, I still think that my beading journey is quite a nice one, even if a little slow (yet still with so much action!)
    Pls tune in for next week! -Z
