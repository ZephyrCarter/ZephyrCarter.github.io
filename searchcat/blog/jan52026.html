<h4>Jan 5, 2026</h4>
  Today is important because of 3 things:
  <p>
  1) I actually made a pricing chart for my beadwork<br>
  2) I am going to continue work on the feather I have been tasked with making<br>
  3) Dogs knocked beads and finery off table<br>
  </p>
  
  <b>Pricing chart</b> - I prepared it for two reasons: 1, I need it for a requireent with a merit badge (I am going to give a 
  sales pitch) so I need to accuratly price my services. 
  Number 2) I am thinking about showing my previous work to some aquantences with the intent to sell 
  <br>
  <b>Feather</b> - I am going to continue working on a feather for my friend, I have gotten one of the two letters done and 
  I hope to get either the start of the second letter done or the entire letter (It is an 's').
  <br>
  <b>And of course, my dogs</b> -  This really happened with my dogs knocking my beads (jewelry I seperatly own) off the table I had them on. Yesterday simularly I had 
  them next to an open window, which promptly blew most of my beads, my feather and a feather I'm working on off and into my 
  dogs bowel??? idk how. 

  <p>
  Wellllllllllllllllp, that has been the 'Bead news' of the day. Stick around for more!
