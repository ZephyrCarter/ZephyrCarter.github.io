  I spawn into the world, looking at a vilage and some sugar cane.

  <div class="simpltext">
    I want to eventully record all the events in this series in-game, and for that I need paper for books, and to make paper I need sugar cane. So the first thing I did is plant some early on, so I don't have to wait later on.
  </div>

<div class="simpltext">
  Alright, after gettig my bearings and planting some sugar cane, it's time to get started!

  <h4 class="simpltext"> Step 1: Decide whether to build here or relocate village</h4>
<hr>
<div class="simpltext">
This location seems good to build into a city; It is relativly flat with lots of rescources to build with around (ie sand). Plus I can build around the stand-alone mesa in the center.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34350190-eeb2-47e5-8819-b439f1e80f84" />
<div class="simpltext">
Seeing as there seem to be two general sections in the village, I am going to seperate it into two sections, building a wall around the "front" part of the village first, as it is a central location, then build a second wall around the "back" part of the village, behind the central mesa. I walling the village off in sections because it is both easier in the early game to collect a small amount of rescources, and thus make a smaller wall around an area, then build off of it once you have gotten more resources and are more established. The second reason is, even if you had enough rescources to wall the entire village, the time it wold take to wall the entire village is to much, leading to ample opprotunity for zombies to pick off all your villagers one by one. This can happen very fast, as I have had an entire village be wiped out in the time it took for me to build a house. Another note is you can contain and control your villagers in every aspect of life, moving them anywhere in the world for any purpose, without risk of them escaping and causing an inconvienience to you if they are lost or die. It is most efficient.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa768e6c-54bf-449f-b134-aee67b9afa29" />
<div class="simpltext">
In the meantime, before I collect the rescources nessicary, I need some food. So I am going to take some wheat for bread.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20874f12-e33f-4b6c-baf4-d459befcfea6" />
<div class="simpltext">
Ok now I am going to start making the wall, and I need rescources to do that. So it's time to start collecting sand!
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1477a04-a7a4-4e75-bffd-81ca9ea572b8" />
<div class="simpltext">
I am now laying the foundations for the wall, because as I have discussed, it is very important to both protect villagers, AND keep them contained, so you can have an accurate head count and have total control over your villagers and all the craftsmen in your city, letting you move them wherever you want at will, while not letting them escape to anywere that is inconvieniant for you to reach them.
</div> 
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1be0c60c-156e-4262-a40c-9d6c20bb0c6c" />
<div class="simpltext">
You have to build right up to the coast as will, walling off any areas where villagers can fall in, and zombies or drowned and attact your villagers.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5733d8b2-1744-456b-a671-54c48e33cf62" />
<div class="simpltext">
Ok, now I have outlined the wall foundations, now it is time for me to move all villager's beds into wall, so when they go to sleep inside the confines of wall, I can lock them in and keep at least some of them safe and under control.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3816640b-a898-4c33-9908-16e447409564" />
<div class="simpltext">
I almost died from a zombie attack in the middle of the day, I need to finsih this wall now!

<div class="simpltext">
Found good place for communal house.

<div class="simpltext">
Ripping up beds in all the houses in the village for the communal house inside of the wall. 
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e88a8ba-fe86-48d4-b9a5-5f7ecb1ca70a" />
<div class="simpltext">
I was going to place all the beds in a central location, however the houses were filled with things and I did not have tools to remove them, so I had to put the beds outside (tent was made for fun). 
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf42345a-b09e-4fb7-9df4-923d965fe399" />
<div class="simpltext">
Need to sleep to keep zombies from spawning.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41967c8d-6431-49c1-82e4-b38c8d081595" />
<div class="simpltext">
I decided to make the settlement smaller, and expand outwards from there. I risk taking too long collecting resources to enclose a larger area, letting zombies kill the entire town in front of me. This means I need to act quickly.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb6c06db-6ebc-4537-ad46-e73e10861093" />
<div class="simpltext">
I am collecting sand from the surrounding area to make the wall and make the terrain look nicer and give it a flatter space to build on.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43dcc7c7-6606-4160-a5ca-d52f9f773a1f" />
<div class="simpltext">
The wall is completed and is totally impregnable.

<div class="simpltext">
I have now pened the gates to let villagers actually come in, and once some get in, I will close it so they dont get out.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf496bc8-9552-499a-bf5c-7cda9dc94c9e" />
<div class="simpltext">
The reason we actually need fence gates because the player can open them but the villagers cannnot, making access and exit from the settlement easier for the player.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11b2cf6-0127-48f3-88cb-5f5f30fa3ea7" />
<div class="simpltext">
I need to collect torches from village houses to place inside the settlement, because zombies can still spawn inside. Note I do not have coal or sticks, so I cannot make torches on my own, meaning I must take them from unused portions of the village.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73d704cb-98e5-425d-8842-62fe109b3a91" />
<div class="simpltext">
I am now breaking all the village profession blocks and placing them in the fort walls so the villagers don't try to get out to go to work, causing them to crowd on the inside of the fort walls trying to get out, and even trying to exit when you do, making you lose villagers.
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c5eaea0-1e73-4fe2-a264-9a9eb7688d7a" />
<div class="simpltext">
Ok, I have some villagers in the wall now, and even though only two are needed to populate the inner-walled settlement, more got in. This is not a problem, and in facr can help move progress even further. 
</div>
<img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5fc9c4-9f25-4f99-9e76-57ee4a4590e9" />
