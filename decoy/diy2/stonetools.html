      This is a larger axe that I had made after my initial axhead chiped. I am either going to continue to grind it and sharpen it until it is thinner, or I will keep as is and use as a blunt waraxe.

            A stone axhead, which I knapped down and ground until perfect. Unfortunatly, after mounting it on a handle and using it on a root, it chipped. A nice souveneer for sure!

            Again another arrowhead, made from the same slate, but this one kinda reminds me of a crossbow-bolt's iron arrowhead. Slim at the bottem, and a little chunky on the side. Overall really like.

      <div class="simpltext">
            Yet another simple arrowhead, made of the same slate at many of the tools here. One of my first, not quite as sharp as the others, but it sure is pretty!

            Perhaps the simplest of tools, this stone striker is a well shaped stone that fits in the palm of your hand is just large enough that you can strck flint or obsidian with minimal risk to yourself.

            A hand saw I made out of slate I found on the banks of a river in Tennessee.
      </div>
      <img width="512" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d20314-5573-444e-a997-c844ad6d9e14" />

      <div class="simpltext">
            This is the first tool I ever made. Made from what I suspect is sandstone I found on the beach, it was originally a large semi-flat rock, but I broke three sides of it off with a larger pointed rock. I was using it as a hammer, but am now going to use it to sharpen tools instead to it does not smash to pieces.
