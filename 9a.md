<h1>Questions I asked Oakland Police Officer 
D. Masis</h1>

<hr>

1. The Second amendment says that in addition to a well regulated militia, the  right to keep and bear arms by the people is essential to a free state. What is your opinion on things like concealed carry, or states regulations on firearms?
<br>
Answer: He said State’s regulations on firearms do not try to stop the people from having them, because it is very clear in the constitution, but State’s laws on them are actually meant to interpret the Constitution. So therefore it’s just up to the States to decide what the constitution meant about the right to bear arms. Some can put laws in place that say you can buy a gun and conceal carry when you turn 18, and others might have laws which state you need to be at least 21 and get a permit for conceal carry.
