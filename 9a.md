<h1>Questions I asked Oakland Police Officer 
D. Masis</h1>

<hr>

1. The Second amendment says that in addition to a well regulated militia, the  right to keep and bear arms by the people is essential to a free state. What is your opinion on things like concealed carry, or states regulations on firearms?
<br>
Answer: Officer Masis said State’s regulations on firearm do not try to stop the people from having them, because it is very clear in the constitution, but State’s laws on them are actually meant to interpret the Constitution. So therefore it’s just up to the States to decide what the constitution meant about the right to bear arms. Some can put laws in place that say you can buy a gun and conceal carry when you turn 18, and others might have laws which state you need to be at least 21 and get a permit for conceal carry.

2. According to the fourth amendment, police cannot search a property without a warrant, except with probable cause, so can you please explain what probable cause is? Can you please give me an example of probable cause?
<br>
Answer: Officer Masis said there are actually two types of probable cause, one being reasonable suspicion, where if someone calls in about a suspicious person wearing specific cloths and describes what race they are, then that is called reasonable suspicion, and if the police see this person around the area, they can detain them and put in squad car. The next is Probable cause, where if there is a concern that would lead to any reasonable person suspecting a crime, like the smell of alcohol for example, the police officer can arrest that person. In order for police to search someone’s house however, they need a search warrant granted by a judge, then they can come in. There is also something called fruit of the poisoned tree, where if you illegally search something, even if they find something incriminating, the person can’t be charged for doing that thing because the fourth amendment is taken very seriously by courts.

3. The first amendment states that among other things, the public has a right to assemble peacefully. What is your opinion on this? What if the protest becomes non peaceful, what should the police do then?
<br>
Answer: Officer Masis said the public right to protest and voice their concerns to the government is very important, and being able to speak your mind, regardless of if others like it, is extremely important. This is because the founding fathers had this vision in mind, that the freedom of speech was so important because it enabled people to speak the truth, even if others don’t agree with it. That is why even if what people say seems hateful or wrong to you, they still have the right to express it and follow their beliefs however they like. However, if the protest becomes violent, then police can get involved, an example is if they start to destroy property, or trespass on private property, then the police can get involved in dispersing them. destruction of property is a big one they are called out to a lot.
